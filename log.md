### Today's Progress
##### UI Design and Prototyping

1. Introduction
This portfolio site plan would be my personal portfolio, which displays various projects including school and personal projects. The site would have three navigation categories, home, Project and contact pages. I plan to design based on a single page application principle and as simple as possible.(take a look the layouts below ).

2.	**Navigation Structure:**
There are 3 navigation links inside the navigation bar, each navigation will have specific content.

-	**HOME:**
 page is the primary page contains basic information about my profession.
-	**PROJECTS:**
   All projects are displayed in this sub page, specific description about each project and technology used to build the project will be presented.

-	**CONTACT:**
My personal email and social medias are the ways to contact me

**Thoughts:** Today I  managed to make Portfolio Mockup. All the desired structure and contents are just plan, obviously there might be some changes during development process. The site would be as simple as possible and contents will be clear and simple as well.
