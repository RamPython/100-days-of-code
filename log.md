### **Today's Progress**: Planning, Setting up project.

**Thoughts:** Still not sure what exactly my Portfolio will looks like, so much ideas. But I am trying to research similar Portfolio pages to get clear picture. My plan is to do more tutorials and practicing and make my portfolio as fast as I can.

**Link to work:** No link at this point.
